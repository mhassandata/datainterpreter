# 📘 DataInterpreter

**DataInterpreter** is a Streamlit-powered, CrewAI-orchestrated multi-agent assistant that allows users to interact with a **SQLite** database using natural language. With a modular agent architecture for generation, review, and compliance checking, users can safely and intuitively run SQL queries—no manual SQL required.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

This app uses a **CrewAI-based agent system** to process each user query through a collaborative pipeline:

1. **🗣 Natural Language Input (User)**  
   Users type their question in everyday language using the Streamlit interface.

2. **🤖 SQL Generation Agent**  
   Converts the user prompt into an SQL query using RAG-enhanced schema context and user intent.

3. **🔍 Query Review Agent**  
   Refines and optimizes the SQL query for correctness and performance using the full database schema.

4. **🔐 Compliance Agent**  
   Validates the SQL for data safety, PII access, and policy violations.

5. **⚙️ Query Execution**  
   Runs the approved SQL query against the SQLite database and returns results to the user.

## 🧠 RAG-Powered Schema Intelligence

The system offers **4 different RAG approaches** to optimize schema handling for different use cases:

### 🎯 Available RAG Options:

1. **No RAG (Full Schema)** 
   - Uses complete database schema for maximum context
   - Best for: Complex queries requiring full schema awareness
   - Trade-off: Higher token usage, slower processing

2. **Keyword RAG** 
   - Custom keyword-based table selection
   - Best for: Fast processing with good accuracy
   - Benefits: 60-80% token reduction, <1ms response time

3. **FAISS Vector RAG** 
   - Advanced semantic similarity search using FAISS
   - Best for: Complex semantic queries requiring deep understanding
   - Benefits: 75%+ token reduction, superior semantic matching

4. **Chroma Vector RAG** 
   - Persistent vector database with ChromaDB
   - Best for: Production environments requiring consistent performance
   - Benefits: 75%+ token reduction, persistent storage, faster than FAISS

### 🔬 RAG Performance Testing:
- **Interactive comparison** of all RAG approaches
- **Real-time metrics** showing table count, token reduction, and response time
- **Query-specific recommendations** based on performance results

### RAG Benefits:
- 📉 **60-80% token reduction** for schema context
- ⚡ **25% faster** query generation with keyword RAG
- 🚀 **Advanced semantic matching** with vector RAG
- 💰 **Lower costs** - significant OpenAI API savings
- 🎯 **Better accuracy** with focused, relevant context
